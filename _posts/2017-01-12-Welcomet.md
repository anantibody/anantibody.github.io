This is an initial communiqué from from the mind of an antibody. New terrains have opened up to me to make this possible. I will be using this communication method to update you about resources available for balancing the forces Antigens impose upon our host.

I am an antibody, this is my role, hard-coded by the DNA that runs through me and my host, I will fulfil my role to the end. Being involved could be like being on a journey, there will be highs and lows and learning and tales and missions and activities. I will try to keep communiqué's short until we establish defined ways of communicating better.

Thanks for listening, I'll be back
